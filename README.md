- **Testing Type**: Manual Testing  
- **Tester**: Kavya K B  
- **Focus Areas**: UI Testing, Functional Testing, Input Validation, Boundary Testing, and User Flow Verification  
- **Skills Applied**:
  - Test Scenario & Test Case Design
  - Requirement Analysis
  - Bug Identification & Reporting
  - Severity & Priority Classification
  - Test Documentation using Excel
  - Functional Flow Understanding
  - Manual Execution & Validation

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project is part of my self-learning journey as a QA enthusiast. My goal was to independently explore a live application, identify its key functionalities, prepare test cases, and document the results using manual testing techniques.

I selected OpenCart because it is a publicly available e-commerce platform with multiple real-world features, ideal for practicing end-to-end testing.

## 👩‍💻 My Role & Responsibilities

As the sole QA tester for this project, I was responsible for:

- Exploring the application and identifying important modules for testing.
- Understanding the functionality of each feature from a user’s perspective.
- Writing detailed test cases with scenario IDs, descriptions, preconditions, test data, steps, expected results, and severity levels.
- Executing all test cases manually and recording the actual results.
- Logging potential issues and categorizing them by severity and priority.
- Maintaining organized documentation in Excel format for each module.

## 💡 My Learning & Experience

- I faced challenges while understanding the flow of some modules like **Wishlist** and **Checkout**, especially when it came to prerequisites (e.g., user login, product selection).
- I had to test various input combinations manually to ensure coverage for **positive and negative** scenarios.
- It helped me improve my ability to think from both **user** and **tester** perspectives.
- Through this project, I also practiced identifying UI issues, functional bugs, and areas lacking proper validation.
- This hands-on experience gave me more confidence in preparing and structuring real-world test cases effectively.
